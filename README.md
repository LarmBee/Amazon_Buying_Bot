# Amazon_Buying_Bot.
 This is a very simple Amazon buying bot that i was testing out just for fun .
 What it does right now is open link we have given it and tell us if the product is in stock or not
 If it is not, it refreshes the page until it is in stock 
 The refresh idea is suitable if we are working with offers we are waiting to drop or releases
 I am still working on it and my main goals are:
 1.Login and search based on Keywords
 2.Add the product to cart if it is available
 3.Checkout and send email to user
